# 100-days-of-swift

I used to develop iOS apps quite [some time ago](https://github.com/ajmaradiaga/NextDepartures) and even learnt Swift when it was just starting. Lots have changed since and this is an attempt to understand how the Swift ecosystem has evolved and hopefully develop an app or two. I'm aiming to develop an app for the Vision Pro eventually.

I'll be capturing in this repo what I learn the next 100 days as I get up to speed with Swift.
